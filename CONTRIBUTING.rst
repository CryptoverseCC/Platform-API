Git Branching Guidelines
------------------------

`dev` is our main development branch

`feature/XYZ-human-readable` format is reserved for new features being developed

`hotfix/XYZ-human-readable` format is reserved for bugfixes, those branches will be treated with priority in builds and review.

Commit Guidelines
-----------------

As a general rule commits should contain `#XYZ` issue number that they belong to (or couple of those if necessary)
